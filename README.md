# TGPA-Calculator
The TGPA Calculator project is a practical and interactive tool designed for students who wish to calculate their Total Grade Point Average (TGPA) efficiently. By entering marks for individual subjects, students can see their grade breakdown, track their academic performance, and easily calculate their TGPA based on predefined grading criteria. The project is fully responsive, making it accessible from any device, and provides features like local storage for saving data and dynamically adding/removing subjects. It is an excellent example of using web technologies to create a useful, user-friendly educational tool.
